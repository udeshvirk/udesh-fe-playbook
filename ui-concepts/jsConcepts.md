Array Functions:
    var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Lemon", "Apple", "Mango"];
    slice (start, end)// doesn't effect original array, doesn't include end index   fruits.slice(1,3) ==== ["Orange", "Lemon"];
    splice (start, deletecount)// does effect original array
    shift ()// Delete first value from original array and return first element
    unshift (val)// push value in first index and return new array length

-Binary Search Tree
-http Headers
-Html Forms
-Event Propagation
-First class Function
- function expression vs statement vs declaration
-Implement Queue Using Stacks
-Count Inversion in an array
-Funtional programming and reactive Progamming
-Composite Function
-What happen when you hit google.com
    https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-happens-when-you-hit-url-in-your-browser/
-Js concepts like closure,memory leaks,execution context,let vs varvs const
-React concepts like hooks,high order components,context apis etc
-Implement any design pattern in js
-find some of the leaf nodes in a tree.
-find kth smallest element in a unsorted array.
-Find the single occuring element is an array  when others ae occurring twice.
-Reverse a string with special characters with out altering the position of special characters.
-Write code for merge sort.
-Crate web page Using any technology ->Issue TRacker of Github (Apis were given)
-Find the kth element in the list.
-find Kth element in a stream of numbers.
-Given a list of numbers, find any number in the list is prefix of another number.
-binary string with wild character, find all possible strings
    010$$0  -> 010000, 010010, 010100, 010110    number of possible strings are 2 to power of n. Here n is no of occurance of wild character
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generate-all-binary-strings-from-given-pattern/   
- pubsub with implementation on,emmit, off, once
- find the leaf node inner text from dom tree B, where exact same dom tree A and leaf node of A is given
