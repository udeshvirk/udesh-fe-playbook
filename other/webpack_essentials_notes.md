# 📦 Webpack Essentials – A Beginner to Pro Guide

Webpack is a powerful module bundler used to compile JavaScript modules and assets for modern web applications.

---

## 📌 What is Webpack?

Webpack is a **static module bundler**. It takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. It is highly configurable and supports advanced features like code splitting, tree-shaking, and module federation.

---

## 🧱 Core Concepts

### 1. Entry

The starting point for building the dependency graph. Webpack starts from this file and resolves all dependencies.

```js
module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index.js",
};
```

### 2. Output

Defines where Webpack emits the bundled files. You can customize the output directory and filenames.

```js
module.exports = {
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "bundle.js",
  },
};
```

### 3. Loaders

Transform files into modules. For example:

- Compile Sass/SCSS into CSS.
- Transpile ES6+ JavaScript using Babel.
- Convert images to base64.

```js
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /\.css$/,
      use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
    },
  ];
}
```

### 4. Plugins

Perform additional tasks like:

- Minifying code.
- Injecting scripts into HTML.
- Cleaning the output directory before builds.

```js
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
plugins: [new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: "./src/index.html" })];
```

### 5. Mode

Specifies the build environment:

- `development`: Unminified, fast builds, includes source maps.
- `production`: Minified, optimized for performance.

## 🔄 Webpack Dev Server

Webpack Dev Server provides a local development server with features like hot module replacement (HMR) and live reloading. It improves the developer experience by instantly reflecting changes in the browser.

```js
devServer: {
  static: './dist',
  hot: true,
  port: 3000,
}
```

## 📂 Typical Project Structure

```
/project-root
  ├── dist/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── index.js
  │   └── styles.css
  ├── package.json
  ├── webpack.config.js
```

A typical Webpack project structure includes:

- `src/`: Contains source files like JavaScript, CSS, and assets.
- `dist/`: Contains the output files generated by Webpack.
- `webpack.config.js`: Configuration file for Webpack.
- `package.json`: Manages dependencies and scripts.

## 🛠 Useful Loaders

| Loader                       | Purpose              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `babel-loader`               | Transpile JS (ES6+)  |
| `style-loader`, `css-loader` | Load and inject CSS  |
| `sass-loader`                | Compile Sass/SCSS    |
| `file-loader`, `url-loader`  | Handle images, fonts |
| `ts-loader`                  | TypeScript support   |

Loaders are essential for transforming files into modules. Some commonly used loaders include:

- `babel-loader`: Transpile modern JavaScript (ES6+) to older versions for browser compatibility.
- `style-loader` and `css-loader`: Load and inject CSS into the DOM.
- `sass-loader`: Compile Sass/SCSS into CSS.
- `file-loader` and `url-loader`: Handle images, fonts, and other assets.
- `ts-loader`: Add TypeScript support.

## 🔌 Useful Plugins

| Plugin                 | Purpose                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `HtmlWebpackPlugin`    | Injects script into HTML           |
| `CleanWebpackPlugin`   | Cleans `dist/` folder before build |
| `MiniCssExtractPlugin` | Extracts CSS into files            |
| `DefinePlugin`         | Define global constants            |

Plugins extend Webpack's functionality. Some commonly used plugins include:

- `HtmlWebpackPlugin`: Automatically injects scripts into your HTML file.
- `CleanWebpackPlugin`: Cleans the `dist/` folder before each build.
- `MiniCssExtractPlugin`: Extracts CSS into separate files.
- `DefinePlugin`: Define global constants for use in your code.

## ⚙️ Example Full Config

```js
const path = require("path");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.[contenthash].js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    clean: true,
  },
  mode: "production",
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "./src/index.html",
    }),
  ],
  devServer: {
    static: "./dist",
    hot: true,
    port: 3000,
  },
};
```

## ⚙️ Advanced Features

### 1. Code Splitting

Split your code into smaller chunks to improve performance and caching. Webpack automatically splits code based on dynamic imports.

### 2. Tree-Shaking

Remove unused code from your final bundle. This works with ES modules (`import/export`) and requires the `production` mode.

### 3. Module Federation

Share code between multiple Webpack builds. This is useful for micro-frontend architectures.

### 4. Cache Busting

Use `contenthash` in filenames to ensure browsers load the latest version of your files.

## 🧪 Tips & Best Practices

- Use `resolve.extensions` to simplify imports for `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, etc.
- Enable `source-map` in development mode for easier debugging.
- Use `splitChunks` to optimize shared dependencies.
- Analyze your bundle size using tools like `webpack-bundle-analyzer`.
