## Design an API for a Travel Booking Platform

### **Context:**

Your company needs to build a travel booking platform that integrates with multiple third-party services (e.g., airlines, hotels, car rentals).

---

### **Task:**

1. Design the high-level architecture for the travel booking platform.
2. Focus on API design and integration with third-party services.
3. Ensure the system is robust and handles failures gracefully.

---

### **Expected Discussion Points:**

- API design principles (e.g., RESTful vs. GraphQL).
- Handling third-party service integration and data aggregation.
- Error handling and retries for failed requests.
- Rate limiting and API gateway considerations.
- Monitoring and logging for API usage and performance.

            |    Client Applications    |

              |  Retry Mechanism)        |
              +-------------+------------+
                          │
                          ▼
              +--------------------------+
              |  Core Booking Engine     |
              | (Reservation, Payment,  |
              |  Cancellation, etc.)     |
              +-------------+------------+
                          │
                          ▼
              +--------------------------+
              |     Data Persistence     |
              | (SQL/NoSQL, Cache, etc.) |
              +--------------------------+
```

The architecture includes:

- **Frontend:** React/Next.js for user interaction.
- **API Gateway:** Centralized entry point for client requests.
- **Aggregation Layer:** Mediates between third-party APIs and the core booking engine.
- **Microservices:** Independent services for flights, hotels, car rentals, and bookings.
- **Databases:** SQL/NoSQL for structured and unstructured data.
- **Monitoring Tools:** Centralized logging, metrics, and tracing.

---

## **2. API Design Principles**

### **A. API Style: RESTful vs. GraphQL**

- **RESTful API:**

  - **Pros:**
    - Clear resource-based URLs.
    - Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
    - Widely adopted and simple to cache.
  - **Use Cases:**
    - Simple retrieval and modification of travel data.

- **GraphQL API:**

  - **Pros:**
    - Clients can request exactly what they need.
    - Efficient aggregation of data from multiple services.
    - Reduced over-fetching.
  - **Use Cases:**
    - Complex queries combining airlines, hotels, and car rental data.

- **Recommendation:**
  - Use a hybrid approach: RESTful for external APIs (simplicity and caching) and GraphQL for internal aggregation and customizable queries.

---

### **B. API Endpoints Design Example (RESTful)**

- **Flights:**

  - `GET /api/flights` – Retrieve available flights based on search criteria.
  - `GET /api/flights/{id}` – Retrieve detailed flight information.

- **Hotels:**

  - `GET /api/hotels` – List hotels with filters (location, rating, etc.).
  - `GET /api/hotels/{id}` – Retrieve hotel details.

- **Car Rentals:**

  - `GET /api/cars` – List available car rental options.
  - `GET /api/cars/{id}` – Retrieve detailed car rental information.

- **Booking:**
  - `POST /api/bookings` – Create a booking (flights, hotels, car rentals).
  - `GET /api/bookings/{id}` – Retrieve booking details.
  - `PUT /api/bookings/{id}/cancel` – Cancel a booking.

---

## **3. Integration with Third-Party Services**

### **A. Data Aggregation & Normalization**

- **Aggregation Layer:**

  - Acts as a mediator between third-party APIs and your core booking engine.
  - Normalizes different data formats into a unified schema.

- **Third-Party API Wrappers:**
  - Develop reusable service adapters for each provider to encapsulate API details and authentication.

---

### **B. Error Handling & Retry Logic**

- **Error Handling:**

  - Detect and distinguish between network errors, rate limits, and business logic failures.
  - Map third-party error responses to your standardized error format.

- **Retry Mechanism:**

  - Implement exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns for transient errors (e.g., network timeouts or 5xx errors).

- **Fallback Strategies:**
  - Cache recent responses to serve as fallback in case of provider unavailability.

---

## **4. API Gateway, Rate Limiting, and Security**

### **A. API Gateway**

- Central entry point for all client requests.
- Implements authentication, SSL termination, request routing, and caching.

### **B. Rate Limiting**

- Protect your backend and third-party integrations by applying rate limits per client/IP.

### **C. Security Measures**

- Use OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect for client authentication.
- Validate and sanitize all incoming data.
- Implement logging and intrusion detection at the gateway level.

---

## **5. Monitoring and Logging**

### **A. Centralized Logging**

- Aggregate logs from all microservices and third-party integrations using ELK stack, Splunk, or Datadog.

### **B. API Metrics**

- Monitor response times, error rates, and throughput using Prometheus/Grafana.

### **C. Alerting**

- Set up alerts for high error rates, slow responses, or service downtime.

### **D. Tracing**

- Use distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) to monitor API call chains and identify bottlenecks.

---

## **6. Handling Failures Gracefully**

### **A. Graceful Degradation**

- Provide partial responses when one or more third-party services fail.

### **B. User Notifications**

- Return standardized error messages and suggest retry actions when errors occur.

### **C. Fallback Content**

- Utilize cached data or alternative providers if the primary service is unavailable.

---

## **Summary**

This high-level design for a travel booking platform focuses on robust API design and third-party integration by:

- Leveraging either RESTful or GraphQL approaches (or a hybrid) to deliver flexible data access.
- Implementing an aggregation layer to normalize data from multiple providers.
- Using an API gateway for centralized authentication, rate limiting, and security.
- Incorporating error handling with retry mechanisms, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation.
- Ensuring robust monitoring, logging, and distributed tracing for proactive performance management.

This architecture is scalable, fault-tolerant, and designed to deliver a seamless user experience even under peak load conditions and when third-party services encounter issues.
