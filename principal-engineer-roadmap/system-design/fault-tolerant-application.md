## ðŸ”‘ **2. Key Components & Redundancy Strategies**

### **A. DNS & Global Load Balancing**

- **Active-Active Configuration:**
  - Uses Anycast DNS routing and geo-distributed load balancers to direct users to the closest available data center.
  - Provides redundancy across geographic regions.

### **B. Edge Servers / CDN**

- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):**
  - Serve static assets from multiple edge locations to reduce load on origin servers.
  - SSL termination at the edge reduces latency and improves security.

### **C. Application Layer**

- **Stateless Microservices:**

  - Designed to be horizontally scalable.
  - Multiple replicas deployed across availability zones; if one instance fails, others handle the load.

- **Redundancy Types:**
  - **Active-Active:** All nodes are active and share load; traffic is balanced evenly.
  - **Active-Passive:** A backup node remains on standby and is activated when the primary fails (often for legacy components or stateful services).

### **D. Data Persistence**

- **Data Replication & Backups:**

  - Use database clusters with synchronous or asynchronous replication (e.g., PostgreSQL with streaming replication, MongoDB replica sets).
  - Automated backups and periodic snapshots to secure secondary storage.

- **Distributed Data Storage:**
  - Employ multi-region deployment strategies to ensure data availability even if one region is down.

---

## ðŸ”„ **3. Failure Mitigation Strategies**

### **A. Circuit Breakers & Retry Mechanisms**

- **Circuit Breaker Pattern:**

  - Monitors service calls and "opens" the circuit when a failure threshold is exceeded, preventing cascading failures.

- **Retry Logic:**

  - Implements exponential backoff and retries for transient failures.

- **Fallback Strategies:**
  - Gracefully degrade service (e.g., serve cached data) when a dependent service is unreachable.

### **B. Health Checks & Monitoring**

- **Regular Health Probes:**

  - Deploy health checks at the load balancer and application levels to monitor node availability.

- **Monitoring Tools:**

  - Use tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, or Datadog for real-time monitoring, alerting, and logging.

- **Automated Failover:**
  - Automatically remove unhealthy nodes from the pool until they recover, then reintegrate them.

### **C. Disaster Recovery Planning**

- **Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategy:**

  - Maintain a DR site with data replicated in near real-time.
  - Regularly test DR procedures to ensure failover processes work as expected.

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO) & Recovery Point Objective (RPO):**
  - Define clear RTO and RPO targets and design the system to meet these requirements.

## ðŸ“ˆ **4. Example Interaction Flow During a Failure**

1. **User Request:**  
   A user makes a request that hits the global load balancer.
2. **Health Check Failure:**  
   If an application instance fails health checks, the load balancer routes traffic away from it.
3. **Circuit Breaker Activates:**  
   Service calls to a failing dependency trigger the circuit breaker, preventing further calls.
4. **Fallback Mechanism:**  
   The application serves cached or default data while retry logic attempts recovery.
5. **Automated Recovery:**  
   Once the instance recovers, health checks pass and the instance is reintegrated into the load balancing pool.
6. **DR Activation:**  
   In the event of a regional outage, traffic is automatically rerouted to a DR site.

## âœ… **5. Summary**

This architecture ensures high availability and fault tolerance by:

- **Distributing load globally** with anycast DNS and active-active load balancing.
- **Minimizing single points of failure** with redundant, stateless microservices and replicated data storage.
- **Implementing proactive measures** like circuit breakers, retries, and health checks.
- **Planning for disaster recovery** with multi-region deployments and automated failover.

By adopting these strategies, the web application can recover gracefully from failures and maintain minimal downtime even under high load.
