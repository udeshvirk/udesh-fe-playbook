## Design a Micro-Frontend Architecture for a Large Web Application

---

### **Context:**

Your company wants to migrate a large, monolithic web application to a micro-frontend architecture to improve scalability and maintainability.

---

### **Task:**

1. Design the high-level architecture for the micro-frontend application.
2. Identify the key components and their interactions.
3. Ensure the system is modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.

---

### **Expected Discussion Points:**

- Micro-frontend principles and benefits.
- Splitting the application into smaller, independent modules.
- Communication and data sharing between micro-frontends.
- Deployment and integration strategies.
- Challenges and trade-offs of micro-frontend architecture.

---

## üöÄ **1. Micro-Frontend Principles & Benefits**

### **What are Micro-Frontends?**

Micro-frontends extend the microservice architecture to the frontend, breaking down a large monolithic frontend application into smaller, independently developed, tested, and deployed UI modules.

### üîë **Key Benefits:**

- **Independent Development & Deployment:** Teams develop, test, and deploy independently.
- **Scalability:** Easier horizontal scaling, distributed workloads.
- **Flexibility & Tech-Agnosticism:** Different teams can choose their technology stacks (React, Angular, Vue, etc.).
- **Improved Maintainability:** Easier to manage smaller codebases and clearly defined boundaries.
- **Reduced Risk:** Lower risk deployments due to modular isolation.

## üì¶ **3. Splitting the Application into Modules**

Each micro-frontend module should align closely with specific business capabilities or product features:

| **Module**            | **Responsibility**                      | **Possible Stack** |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Authentication**    | User login, registration, user profile  | React              |
| **Dashboard**         | Aggregating data and KPIs visualization | Angular            |
| **Reporting**         | Reports, analytics, data visualization  | Vue.js             |
| **Administration**    | User roles, permissions, system config  | React              |
| **E-commerce Module** | Product catalog, cart, checkout         | Svelte             |

### **Best Practice:**

Define clear boundaries around business domains (Domain-Driven Design principles).

---

## üîÑ **4. Communication & Data Sharing Between Micro-Frontends**

### üìå **Communication Patterns:**

- **Event Bus (Pub/Sub):**  
  Event-driven architecture (e.g., Custom Events, RxJS).
- **Shared State Management:**  
  Lightweight global store (Redux Toolkit, Zustand).
- **URL Routing & Parameters:**  
  Query params for state synchronization.

### üìå **Recommended Approaches:**

- Keep inter-frontend communication minimal and loosely coupled.
- Use event-driven communication for state sharing without direct coupling.

Example

```typescript
// Micro-Frontend A emits event
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("user-logged-in", { detail: user }));

// Micro-Frontend B listens to event
window.addEventListener("user-logged-in", (e) => {
  const user = e.detail;
  // Update local state
});
```

## üìå **5. Deployment & Integration Strategies**

### üîπ **Integration Approaches:**

| **Approach**               | **Description**                                                           | **Pros**                                | **Cons**                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Build-Time Integration** | Micro-frontends bundled at build-time (Webpack Module Federation)         | Simplified deployment, good performance | Less runtime flexibility |
| **Runtime Integration**    | Micro-frontends loaded dynamically at runtime (iframes, script injection) | Flexible, independent deployments       | Performance trade-offs   |

### üîπ **Recommended Strategy:**

- **Webpack Module Federation** for build-time integration.
- Enables independent builds and deployments, good performance, seamless experience.

### üîπ **CI/CD & Deployment:**

- Each micro-frontend has its own CI/CD pipeline.
- Automated deployments (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
- Independent versioning and semantic version management.

## üìä **6. Challenges & Trade-offs**

| **Challenges**                   | **Mitigation Strategies**                                                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Consistent UX/UI**             | Centralized shared Design System (Storybook, Tailwind UI).               |
| **Performance Overhead**         | Build-time integration with module federation for minimal overhead.      |
| **Complex Routing & Navigation** | Centralized routing and shared shell/container application.              |
| **Version Compatibility**        | Strong semantic versioning & backward compatibility strategies.          |
| **Communication Complexity**     | Minimize cross-module communication, use simple events or shared stores. |

## üîß **7. Key Components & Interactions**

### üìå **Shell (Host Application):**

- Centralized navigation, authentication, layout.
- Provides placeholders for micro-frontends to mount.
- Uses Webpack Module Federation to integrate micro-frontends.

### üìå **Micro-Frontend Modules:**

- Each developed independently, loaded dynamically.
- Export components that can be consumed by shell or other micro-frontends.

### üìå **API Gateway & Backend:**

- Unified API gateway for simplified backend interactions.
- Backend microservices aligned with frontend micro-frontend domains.

## üõ† **8. Example Technology Stack**

| **Layer**                | **Technology Recommendations**                     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shell Application**    | React, Vue, or Angular + Webpack Module Federation |
| **Micro-frontends**      | React, Angular, Vue, Svelte (freedom per team)     |
| **Communication Layer**  | Custom events, RxJS, Redux Toolkit, Zustand        |
| **Routing & Navigation** | React Router, Angular Router, Vue Router           |
| **Authentication**       | Auth0, AWS Cognito, Okta                           |
| **Backend**              | Node.js (NestJS), Spring Boot, .NET                |
| **CI/CD**                | Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD              |
| **Hosting & CDN**        | AWS CloudFront, Vercel, Netlify                    |

## üìê **9. Example Interaction Flow**

**User Navigates Through Application:**

1. User logs in through the Shell Application.
2. Shell loads Dashboard micro-frontend dynamically.
3. Dashboard requests data via API Gateway to microservices.
4. User navigates to Reporting ‚Üí Shell dynamically loads Reporting micro-frontend.
5. Communication between micro-frontends via events for synchronization.

## üéØ **10. Summary & Justification**

This architecture:

- **Maximizes modularity:** Clearly separates business concerns.
- **Enhances scalability:** Independent scaling and deployment.
- **Optimizes maintainability:** Smaller, focused codebases.
- **Supports technology diversity:** Flexibility in technology choice per team.
