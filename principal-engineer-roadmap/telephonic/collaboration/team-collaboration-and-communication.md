## My Experience Working in Teams

Throughout my career, I've had extensive experience collaborating closely with diverse teams—including frontend and backend developers, designers, product managers, QA, and DevOps engineers—on large-scale, cross-functional projects.

For example, I recently worked on developing an enterprise-grade HRM platform involving teams distributed across different geographies and cultures. This required meticulous coordination, clear communication, and collaborative problem-solving to deliver consistently high-quality software.

### 5. Regular Alignment and Visibility

- **Weekly Sync-ups:**  
  Scheduled regular cross-team sync meetings (e.g., frontend-backend sync, design-engineering sync) to proactively align expectations, identify risks early, and resolve dependencies swiftly.
- **Transparent Updates:**  
  Maintained transparency by sharing updates frequently, highlighting progress, potential issues, and acknowledging contributions publicly to boost morale.

### 6. Mentoring and Knowledge Sharing

- **Technical Workshops and Training:**  
  Conducted regular internal tech talks and knowledge-sharing sessions on best practices, emerging technologies, and architectural decisions to level up the entire team.
